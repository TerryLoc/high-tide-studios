    shortBio:
      'Decades of broadcast experience from pirate radio to national broadcasting.',
    fullBio: `Colm Hayes brings decades of broadcast experience to High Tide Studios, with a career that spans the formative years of Irish radio through to today's multi-platform media landscape.

He began his broadcasting journey during the pioneering era of pirate radio in the 1980s, cutting his teeth at Radio Nova, where instinct, timing, and voice mattered more than polish. That grounding shaped his approach to radio as a craft—built on connection, authenticity, and respect for the listener.

In the 1990s, Colm became a household voice on FM104, most notably through The Strawberry Alarm Clock, a show that defined a generation of breakfast radio with pace, humour, and sharp conversational rhythm. His work during this period established him as a serious presenter with a natural ability to lead live conversation while keeping audiences engaged.

The 2000s saw Colm move to national broadcasting with RTÉ 2FM, where he further refined his on-air style and worked within the demands and disciplines of public service broadcasting.

Today, Colm presents on Classic Hits FM, co-hosting a flagship show with Lucy Kennedy. His current work reflects the maturity of a broadcaster who understands how to balance personality, pace, and credibility across live radio and digital platforms.

At High Tide Studios, Colm leads new business and brings this lifetime of broadcast instinct to every project. He helps clients shape conversations, find their natural on-mic presence, and develop podcasts that feel grounded, confident, and worth listening to.`,
